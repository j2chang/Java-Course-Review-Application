Hello, welcome to our Course Review Program made by Jason Kim, Aaron Ko, and Allie Kim.

Our code is going to have UI/Display using JavaFx and will be utilizing SQL for the database.  For the database, there is one already created called Reviews.sqlite3
and already has a few users/courses/and reviews already in it. 

In order to RUN THE PROGRAM:  Go to the reviewguiApplication.java file that is located in src/main/java/edu/virginia/cs/gui.  When you run, the screen should pop up 
after a few seconds.  

Here are the usernames/passwords that are already in the database:
Username:             Password:
Test1                 Test1PW
Test2                 Test2PW
Test3                 Test3PW
Test4                 Test4PW

*These accounts have already written review, so if you do a class like CS 3140, it may not work and will tell you that a review has been already written.
